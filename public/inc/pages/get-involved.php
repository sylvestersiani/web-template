			<h4>We are recruiting for Trustees!!!</h4>

			<p class="subtext"><b>Calling all those passionate about mental health awareness!</b></p>


			<p>We would like to build a fair, unbiased and robust Board of Trustees that will provide direction and oversight to Kwetu Caritas, and help us to ensure that what we are doing and set out to do is as effective as possible. We are seeking candidates who are as passionate about mental health within the black community as we are, who have great creativity and strategic thinking, who have the right networks, and who will ultimately help steer the organisation in achieving its core aims.</p>
			<p>We particularly welcome applications from older candidates and those from a diverse background as these groups are currently under-represented on our Board. Please note these are voluntary positions (reasonable travel expenses will be reimbursed); and Trustees will be expected to attend 6 Board meetings per annum. For more information, please fill out our <a href="index.php?page=contact">contact form</a>. Alternatively, send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@kwetu.org.uk">info@kwetu.org.uk</a>.</p>
